This is a collection of analyses of Wisconsins covid-19 wastewater data. The data is collected at most of Wisconsins wastewater treatment facilities by the direction of the SLH. The DHS which works closely with the SLH also provies us with data about cases in wisconsin. Here at the DSI we use our own R package that we developed ([DSIWastewater]([url](https://github.com/AFIDSI/DSIWastewater))) along with other methods to analize all of the data we are given and the results can be seen in this repo.
