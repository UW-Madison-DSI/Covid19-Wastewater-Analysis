Welcome, we conduct advanced analysis of Wisconsin's COVID-19 wastewater data. In collaboration with the SLH and the DHS, we leverage our expertise and our proprietary R package, ([DSIWastewater]([url](https://github.com/AFIDSI/DSIWastewater))), to uncover valuable insights. Our analyses provide crucial information for policymakers, public health officials, and researchers working to understand COVID-19 transmission and implement effective interventions. Explore our repository to learn more about our research and methodologies. Together, we contribute to a healthier and safer future for Wisconsin and beyond.
