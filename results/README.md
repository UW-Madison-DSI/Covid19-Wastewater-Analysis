This collection consists of the output of 26 distinct R code segments that explore various wastewater processes. The content is divided into 7 sections.

1. CoVariants:
   This section examines different factors related to cases and wastewater concentration, such as PMMoV, time, and Bcov. \

2. day_of_week_effect: \
   This section investigates the influence of the day of the week on reported cases. It reveals that case data exhibits significant fluctuations based on the day of reporting, while wastewater data is less affected.

3. DHS_presentation: \
   This section generates the plots utilized in the presentation given to the NWSS Data Analysis group on May 2, 2023. It covers topics such as normalization, data cleaning, variant analysis, and identifying the optimal offset.

4. flagging: \
   This section examines the DHS method for flagging increases and decreases of Covid in the community. It particularly focuses on the role of offset, smoothing, and different parameters in the process.

5. noise: \
   This section analyzes how noise is distributed among different subsets. It also investigates the variation of covariates in relation to noise.

6. sampling: \
   This section investigates how downsampling affects the stability of the results.

7. trend_analysis: \
   This is the largest section containing time series analysis aimed at capturing the most effective comparison between case data and wastewater data.
